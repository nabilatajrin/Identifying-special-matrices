# Identifying-special-matrices

#### Matrices in PythonÂ¶
In the numpy package in Python, matrices are indexed using zero for the top-most column and left-most row. I.e., the matrix structure looks like this:

A[0, 0]  A[0, 1]  A[0, 2]  A[0, 3]
A[1, 0]  A[1, 1]  A[1, 2]  A[1, 3]
A[2, 0]  A[2, 1]  A[2, 2]  A[2, 3]
A[3, 0]  A[3, 1]  A[3, 2]  A[3, 3]
You can access the value of each element individually using,

A[n, m]
which will give the n'th row and m'th column (starting with zero). You can also access a whole row at a time using,

A[n]
Which you will see will be useful when calculating linear combinations of rows.

A final note - Python is sensitive to indentation. All the code you should complete will be at the same level of indentation as the instruction comment.
